  <span class="para-head">Zen of Running</span>
  <div class="sub-para">
    Movement without effort, awareness without thinking.
    This is the zen of running. I've found that achieving this state requires simplicity.
    Simplicity means saying <i>no</i> to habits and gadgets common to many runners.
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    <span class="block">No music players or headphones.</span>
    <span class="block">No stopwatches or split times.</span>
    <span class="block">No GPS watches or pace tracking.</span>
    <span class="block">No heart-rate monitors.</span>
    <span class="block">No mobile phones or touchscreen devices, velcro-strapped to one arm.</span>
    <span class="block">And certainly no chest-mounted GoPro cameras.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    Gadgets, although in some cases helpful, become distractions.
    I've found that it's impossible to achieve a zen state of running with any gadgets present.
    But there's a bit more to simplicity than unplugging: it's also necessary to let 
    go of training goals and expectations--and this goes hand-in-hand with leaving gadgets
    behind. After all, how could I measure split times or pace without a chonometer?
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    The pure essense of running is the act itself. Putting one foot in front of the other.
    Moving through space. And I think it matters what that space is:
    I've never achieved a zen state of running on a treadmill, or doing circles around a track.
    Outside, especially on a sunny day, with mountains in view, away from a city and its noise,
    it's pretty easy to achieve a zen state of running.
    In fact, with cooperative weather and a well-chosen route, it's all but guaranteed to happen.

  <span class="para-head">One Number</span>
  <div class="sub-para">
    Running can generate a lot of numbers, especially
    when someone is training for (or participating in) a race.
    Pace, distance, mile splits, elevation gained and lost, to name only a few.
    However, in my <a href="/runlog">run log</a>, I only record one number: distance.
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    Even though I rarely wear a watch when running, I am always aware 
    of the distance of of my runs. I know the distance because I usually
    run known routes. When I'm running an unknown route, I use a GPS watch
    to measure distance, after which the route becomes known to me, and
    thereafter I can run the route without GPS.
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    I find that running known routes without a watch allows me to focus on the pure
    essense of running, while still allowing me log distance for later analysis.

  <div class="sub-para">
    Now that I have almost 3 years of run log entries, my data can answer some interesting questions.
    Here are some examples:
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    <span class="block">How many miles per month have I run, in 2013? 2012? 2011? All time?</span>
    <span class="block">What is the average run distance for each day of the week?</span>
    <span class="block">On average, how many times do I run in a given month? Summer vs. winter?</span>
    <span class="block">What fraction of my runs are over ten miles in distance?</span>
    <span class="block">What fraction of my runs are on roads? Trails?</span>
    <span class="block">What footwear do I most commonly run in?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="sub-para">
    <span class="block">A lot of possibilities arise from date, distance, surface and footwear information.</span>
    <span class="block">As I develop this site more, I plan to feature charts answering the above questions and more.</span>
